![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) 

This is an ongoing project that demonstrates how to build an admin console with Angular and Bootstrap.

Each lesson is a separate branch. The latest state of the whole project is in the master branch.

## Dependencies
DON'T FORGET TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES! You can do that easily by opening a command prompt, going to
the directory where this project is located, and typing:

```
npm install
```

That's it. That should do it.

If you're still having issues, you might need to blow away everything in the node_modules directory
run npm install again.
